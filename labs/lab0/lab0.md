# Overview

## Abstract

KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. The aim is to provide a common ground for virtualization solutions on top of Kubernetes.

This lab is targeted towards people who donâ€™t have any KubeVirt experience but must have some familiarity with Kubernetes and *kubectl*.

The goal is to show you how to run KubeVirt locally and get a bit familiar with it.

We will use a dedicated public VM per student.

## Lab Overview

* Deploy and explore KubeVirt
* Deploy a virtual machine using Kubevirt
* Access the virtual machine
* Create a vm using persistent storage
* Create a multi-homed VM using Multus
* Explore the Kubevirt web UI
* Explore metrics through Grafana
