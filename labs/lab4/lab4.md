# Lab 4

## Deploy our first Virtual Machine

To start with, we'll be deploying a VM that uses a [ContainerDisk](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/docs/latest/creating-virtual-machines/disks-and-volumes.html#containerdisk). It won't use any of the available PVs, ContainerDisk use ephemeral disk space.

```console
$ cd ~/student-materials
$ kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=default
$ kubectl create -f vm_containerdisk.yml
virtualmachine.kubevirt.io/vm1 created
```

Check for the VM we just created:

```console
$ kubectl get vm vm1
NAME   AGE   RUNNING   VOLUME
vm1    24s   false
```

Notice it's not running, that's actually coming from its definition we've just applied:

```yaml
...
spec:
  running: false
...
```

The *VirtualMachine* object is the definition of our VM, now we can instantiate it using *virtctl* as follows:

```console
$ virtctl start vm1
VM vm1 was scheduled to start
```

A *virt-launcher* Pod should be starting now, which will spawn the actual virtual machine instance (or VMI):

```console
$ kubectl get pods -w
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
virt-launcher-vm1-2qflc   0/2     Running   0          12s
virt-launcher-vm1-2qflc   0/2     Running   0          12s
virt-launcher-vm1-2qflc   1/2     Running   0          17s
virt-launcher-vm1-2qflc   2/2     Running   0          23s
```

We can also use *kubectl* to check the virtual machine and its instance:

```console
$ kubectl get vm vm1
NAME   AGE   RUNNING   VOLUME
vm1    19m   true

$ kubectl get vmi vm1
NAME   AGE     PHASE     IP            NODENAME
vm1    3m49s   Running   10.244.0.22   sjr-kubemaster.deshome.net
```

Using *virtctl* we can connect to the VMI's console as follows:

```console
$ virtctl console vm1
Successfully connected to vm1 console. The escape sequence is ^]

## Recap

* We've defined a *VirtualMachine* object on the cluster which didn't actually start the *vm1*
* We've started the *vm1* using *virtctl*, which instantiated it creating the *VirtualMachineInstance* object
  * *kubectl patch* could have also been used to start *vm1*
* Finally, we've connected to the *vm1's* serial console using *virtctl*


This concludes this section of the lab, before heading off to the next lab, spend some time describing and exploring the objects this lab created on the cluster.
